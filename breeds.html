                    Bengal cats are smart, energetic and playful and they often enjoy playing in water. Bengals may appear larger than they are because of their muscular bodies. They get along well with other pets when properly introduced and enjoy being part of a family.

                    The Maine Coon is the largest breed of domestic cat. On average, males weigh from 5.9 to 8.2 kg.  The body is solid and muscular, which is necessary for supporting their own weight, and the chest is broad. Equally at home with children, dogs, or older persons, the Maine Coon is an ideal pet, handily earning its status as the second most popular breed in America, as well as it's fond nickname, "The Gentle Giant."
